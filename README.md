CS1520, University of Pittsburgh, Spring 2016.

Yooooo. Here's the repo for my CS1520 project part 2 submission.

Project part 1 files are in the "Legacy" folder.
Project part 2 files are in the "site" folder.

The text file answering questions about the project is in the Legacy folder 
as directed and is titled "WhatILearned.txt"

Enjoy! Feedback is welcome.
